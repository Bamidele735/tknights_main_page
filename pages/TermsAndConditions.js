This includes, for example, downloads and streamings. However, pursuant to Section 356 (5) of the German Civil Code (BGB), this right of withdrawal shall expire prior to the expiration of the withdrawal period if the entrepreneur has commenced performance of the contract after the consumer has expressly consented to the entrepreneur commencing performance of the contract prior to the expiration of the withdrawal period and has confirmed his knowledge that his consent will cause him to lose his right of withdrawal upon commencement of performance of the contract. We give the consumer in the purchase process the opportunity to give such consent by ticking, but point out in the purchase process again separately to this possibility and the legal consequence, expiry of the right of withdrawal. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(3) For the rest, the regulations apply to the right of withdrawal, which are reproduced in detail</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">are in the following </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">cancellation policy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Cancellation policy</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Section 1</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right of revocation</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can revoke your contractual declaration within 14 days without giving reasons</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">by means of a clear declaration.
